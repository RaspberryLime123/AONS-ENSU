# AONS-ENSU
 A batch file tool to automate the process of updating old ONScripter-EN executables. 
 
 DEPENDENCIES:
 - onscripter-en-win32_dsound-20110628.zip or onscripter-en-win32-20110628. download them from [kaisernet.org](http://kaisernet.org/onscripter/#builds)
 - Windows
 
 Usage:
 1. Download the AONS-ENSU.bat, and move it to a folder. I will use C:\Users\random\example as an example, but anytime you see C:\Users\random\example, you  should replace it with the path to the folder you chose on your machine
 2. Move your chosen .zip file to the same folder (C:\Users\random\example)
 3. Press Ctrl + r, type cmd, and hit enter (or open cmd.exe in some other way)
 4. Move into the AONS-ENSU folder by typing "cd C:\Users\random\example" and pressing enter.
 5. Call the batch file as shown below. If the game path or the game name have spaces in them, surround them with quotes. For example, A Midsummer Day's Resonance becomes "A Midsummer Day's Resonance".
