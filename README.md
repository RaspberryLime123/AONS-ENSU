# AONS-ENSU
 A batch file tool to automate the process of updating old ONScripter-EN executables. 
 
 DEPENDENCIES:
 unzip.exe https://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/files/UnZip%206.x%20%28latest%29/UnZip%206.0/ (already included)

 This batch file requires a zip archive with the necessary contents to update the Old ONS-EN installation. Get one from kaisernet.org
 This should run on any windows system, post Win2000. 
 
 This script will ask for user input to determine the game directory, and the game name. If there is no zip archive that matches the name of the 
 most up-to-date ONS-EN zip archives, it will ask the user choose another zip archive by specifying it's name.
 In the unlikely event that both of the most up-to-date ONS-EN zip archives are present, the script will ask the user to pick one.
 
 This script does not automatically rename the updated ONS-EN executable
